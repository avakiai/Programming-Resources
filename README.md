# Scientific Resources
Hi! Here I've compiled a few lists of resources for statistics, bioacoustics, signal processing, data visualization, and data manipulation (mainly in R). I use these lists often for personal reference, but hope it can also prove useful to others. There's also links to helpful blogs and gitbooks on theoretical topics helpful when starting new analyses.
